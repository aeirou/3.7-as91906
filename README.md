# digi-2024
Hi Readers,

It is currently Sunday 10th of March 2024 and this will be my first project since I was in Level 1 NCEA.

 This project contains an adventure game where the player will need to progress through a tower of three floors in order to reach the end. The player will counter valuable chests, monsters where pve (in-draft — may change in the future) is currently text based. Once the player has climbed onto the last floor and reached the last location, the player will initiate combat with the final boss. Upon defeating this boss, the game finishes.

 I look forward to creating this game into one I could be proud of in the future. 

 Thanks for reading.
